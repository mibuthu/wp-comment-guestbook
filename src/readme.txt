Add a guestbook page which uses the wordpress integrated comments.


== Description ==

The purpose of this plugin is to add a guestbook site which uses the wordpress integrated comments.
Using the wordpress integrated comments system has some important advantages:

* Consistent styling of guestbook form and comment list for every theme you are using.
* All wordpress comment features are available for the guestbook comments also (e.g. E-Mail Notification, listing in "All Comments" on admin page,...)
* All plugins which are modifying the comment list or comment form will also work with Comment Guestbook automatically (e.g. a captcha plugin for antispam).

= Other features and options: =
* Setup comment form position (in page, above comment list, below comment list). You can also use more than one.
* Adjust the comment form (change texts, hide elements)
* Ajdust the comment order (newest first, oldest first)
* Option to show numbered pagination links for the comment list
* Ajdust the comment html-code for the guestbook page
* Option to include all comments of your site in the comment list on the guestbook page
* Sidebar widget to show recent comments with a lot of options
* Show a message after a new comment was made. This option you can also enable for all post/pages in your blog

= Usage: =
Simply insert the shortcode `[comment-guestbook]` into a page to enable this plugin.

On the admin page (goto Comments -> About Guestbook) you can find a detailed description. In the admin area you can find a settings page with a lot of options to modify the behavior and output.

= Development: =
If you want to follow the development status have a look at the [git-repository on github](https://github.com/mibuthu/wp-comment-guestbook "wp-comment-guestbook at github").
Feel free to add your merge requests there, if you want to help to improve the plugin.

= Translations: =
Please help translating this plugin into multiple languages.
You can submit your translations at [transifex.com](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wp-comment-guestbook "wp-comment-guestbook at transifex").
There the source strings will always be in sync with the actual development version.


== Installation ==

The easiest way to install is using the wordpress plugin installation mechanism. On the admin page you can install new plugins in "Plugins" -> "Add new". Search for "Comment Guestbook" and press "Install now".

If you want to install the plugin manually download the zip-file and extract the files in your wp-content/plugins folder.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the settings to manipulate the output (e.g. of the comment list)? =
You can find a lot of options on the admin page in the submenu "Comments" -> "Guestbook". There you have the possibility to change the output of e.g the comment list only for the guestbook page, independent from the general Wordpress settings.

= I have included the shortcode in my guestbook page but the comment form and/or the comment list are not appearing. =
Please check if comments are enabled for your guestbook page. There are several places to change these setting:

* General wordpress discussion setting (Settings -> Discussion -> "Allow people to post comments on new articles"): This setting changes the behavior for all pages and post, but can be overwritten by the settings below.
* Post/page discussion setting (Discussion box -> "Allow comments." in post/page edit screen): This setting overrides the general wordpress setting for each page or post. If you cannot see the Discussion box you have to enable it in the Screen Option.
* Theme settings: A lot of themes have their own options for displaying the comment list. They often will override the wordpress settings.
* Guestbook settings (Comments -> Guestbook -> General Settings -> "Guestbook comment status": This option will override the wordpress settings for the guestbook page. But the theme settings can still causes problems.

If you still have problems after checking all these possibilities there is one more option available in the Guestbook settings (Comments -> Guestbook -> Comment-list settings -> "Show the comment list in the page content".
If you enable this option the comment list will be displayed in the page content instead of the seperate comment section. After that the comment list should be displayed also with themes which specifies no comment section for pages.
Have a look at the option description on the settings page for detailed information.

= Can I call the shortcode directly via php e.g. for my own template, theme or plugin? =
Yes, you can create an instance of the "CGB_Shortcode" class which located in "includes/shortcode.php" in the plugin folder and call the function show_html($atts).With $atts you can specify all the shortcode attributes you require. Another possibility would be to call the wordpress function "do_shortcode()".
